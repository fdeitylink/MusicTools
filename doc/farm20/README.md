# FARM Canon and Fugue

These are two short pieces composed with
[MusicTools](https://github.com/halfaya/MusicTools) a toolkit for the
creation and analysis of music using functional techniques. It is
written in Agda and was inspired by the Haskell [Euterpea](http://www.euterpea.com/) library.

## Canon

The
[Canon](https://github.com/halfaya/MusicTools/blob/master/agda/FarmCanon.agda)
is generated from a simple two-bar melody which is copied and modified
using standard transformations (inversion, retrograde and retrograde
inversion) that are particularly natural using functional
programming. As inversion is chromatic this creates dissonances but
the underlying structure can still be discerned.

## Fugue
